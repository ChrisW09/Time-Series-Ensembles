# The pipeline accepts custom weighting schemes and regression metamodels from the sklearn library (by now)
# I am not sure if models from other libraries work as well (not yet tested)
# They should work, when they have a .fit(X_t, y_t) and a .predict(X_(t+1)) method
# where X_t or X_(t+1) are the predictions from the individual models in period t or t+1
# and y_t are the actual values in period t
# See models here:
