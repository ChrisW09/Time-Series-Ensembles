Splitting data for training of forecasters (train/test ratio: 30/70)...
Initial training set has 72 observations and goes from 2004-01 to 2009-12.

In an historical expanding window approach, there are 168 periods to be forecasted by the individual models: 2010-01 to 2023-12
Out-of-sample predictions are generated for next period: 2024-01

Now generating 168 one-step ahead historical expanding window predictions from model: Naive (sktime)
Performing out-of-sample predictions...
...finished!
