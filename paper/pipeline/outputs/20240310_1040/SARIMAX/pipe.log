== Pipeline Step 2: Individual Models' Predictions ==
=====================================================

Splitting data for training of forecasters (train/test ratio: 30/70)...
Initial training set has 26 observations and goes from 2004-01 to 2006-02.

In an historical expanding window approach, there are 58 periods to be forecasted by the individual models: 2006-03 to 2010-12
Out-of-sample predictions are generated for next period: 2011-01

Now generating 58 one-step ahead historical expanding window predictions from model: Naive (sktime)
Performing out-of-sample predictions...
...finished!

Now generating 58 one-step ahead historical expanding window predictions from model: AutoSARIMAX with covariates (sktime)
Auto-fitting model. Refitting every 20th period.
