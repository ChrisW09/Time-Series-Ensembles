# You can easily add and remove ensembling approaches by commenting them out.
# Further, you can add new meta models by levereging the sklearn library.
# See models here:
# sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
#
# I am not sure if models from other libraries work as well (not yet tested).
# They should work, when they have a .fit(X_t, y_t) and a .predict(X_(t+1)) method
# where X_t or X_(t+1) are the predictions from the individual models in period t or t+1
# and y_t are the actual values in period t.
#
# The framework also accepts custom weighting schemes placed in the src/models/ensemblers folder/weighted folder.
weighted:
  Simple: equal_weights # Note that the key "Simple" is the ensembler's name! If you want to select_ensemblers, use this string!
  Inverse RMSE: inv_rmse_weights
  Inverse Variance: inv_variance_weights
  Inverse Error Covariance: inv_error_cov_weights
meta:
  SVR: # Note that this is the ensembler's name! If you want to select_ensemblers, use this string!
