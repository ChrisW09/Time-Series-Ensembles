Splitting data (train/test ratio: 10/90)...
Initial training set has 12 observations 
and goes from 2004-01-01 to 2004-12-01
There are 108 periods to be forecasted: 
2005-01-01 to 2013-12-01

Now generating 108 one-step ahead expanding window predictions from model: Naive (sktime)
...finished!

Now generating 108 one-step ahead expanding window predictions from model: Naive (drift) (sktime)
...finished!

Now generating 108 one-step ahead expanding window predictions from model: AutoSARIMA (sktime)
Auto-fitting model. Refitting every 36th period.
