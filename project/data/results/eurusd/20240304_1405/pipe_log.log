Searching for time information...
Dates found in 'index' column!
Inferred frequency: 15T
Data from goes from 2020-01-01 to 2020-04-14, resulting in 10000 observations.

Aggregating data to frequency 'business day' using method 'last' and dropping NaNs...
...finished!
Data now has 74 observations.

Selecting target and covariates...

Splitting data (train/test ratio: 30/70)...
Initial training set has 22 observations 
and goes from 2020-01-02 to 2020-01-31
There are 52 periods to be forecasted: 
2020-02-03 to 2020-04-14

Now generating 52 one-step ahead expanding window predictions from model: Naive (sktime)
